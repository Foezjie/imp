        <title>History and acknowledgments</title>

        <para>IMP is the integration of six years of research, three system
        configuration tool prototypes, the use of most of the state-of-the-art
        tools available on the market and hours of dicussions with system
        administrators around the world that are doing the real work on a day
        to day basis. This reasearch track was started in 2006 by Thomas Delaet
        under the supervision of Wouter Joosen at DistriNet, KULeuven. In 2007
        Bart Vanbrabant joined while working on this master thesis and in 2008
        working full time on this research.</para>
        
        <para>This work would not have been possible without the support and
        funding of DistriNet, KULeuven, iMinds and the two personal
        scholarschips of the IWT.</para>
